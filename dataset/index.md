# Lifelong Robotic Vision Dataset

We will provide a dataset, along with benchmarking tools, for the Lifelong Robotic Vision Competition on IROS 2019 and for any other research purpose.nCurrently we are collecting data by ourselves, but we welcome contribution of data from third parties, as long as the data are relevant to lifelong robotic vision research and are in a good enough quality. Please contact [Xuesong Shi](mailto:xuesong.shi@intel.com) for data contribution.
