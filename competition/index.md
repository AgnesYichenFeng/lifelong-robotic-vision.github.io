# Lifelong Robotic Vision Competition

The competition is composed of two challenges with separate scoreboards. Each team can register for either challenge or both. The competition will mostly be online, with an on-site event at [IROS 2019](https://www.iros2019.org/) to announce the final scores, demonstrate the best results, and hold technical talks and discussions.

For the details of each challenge, please follow their webpages:
