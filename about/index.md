# Me

My name is Yingkai Liu. I am currently a senior student in Nankai University, China. I major in Physics. 

With more understanding of physics, I found the theory used to describe a phenomenon is more and more elegant but in the same time complicated. I was happy about the differential equations, impressed by linear algebra, struck by group theory and now mesmerized by topology and differential geometry. **I am aware that physics requires much more than *just* mathematics. In the same time I believe that with more mathematics there will be deeper physics.** 

As for my current interest, on homepage I wrote:

> I am interested in the Topological properties of materials and the phenomenon of integer discreetness arising from continuous symmetry. In a different perspective, I am also interested in how particles subject to relatively simple laws can exhibit novel collective properties. I also like coding and enjoy sharing my thoughts.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/yk-liu/yk-liu.github.io/raw/master/about/CV-of-Liu-Yingkai.pdf) (last update: 2018-11-14).

# The Site

This website, built from code pieces from various sources, is not unlike the Frankenstein's Monster. This website, having responsibility in conveying knowledge and a nice touch of humor, however, is unlike the Frankenstein's Monster.

When I started writing on this website, I wanted to share notes on what I have learnt. I benefited a lot from many insightful blogs and now I have something to give back. Watching my notes published on websites also gives me motivation and a strange consolation. 

I also realized that this website can be used as a billboard of my professional backgrounds. This is a great proof for what I have learned.
