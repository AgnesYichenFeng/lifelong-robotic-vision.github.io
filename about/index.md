My name is Yingkai Liu. I am interested in the Topological properties of materials and the phenomenon of integer discreetness arising from continuous symmetry. In a different perspective, I am interested in how particles subject to relatively simple laws can exhibit novel collective properties. I also like coding and enjoy sharing my thoughts.
