# Lifelong Robotic Vision Dataset

We will provide a dataset, along with benchmarking tools, for the Lifelong Robotic Vision Competition on IROS 2019 and for any other research purpose.Currently we are collecting data by ourselves, but we welcome contribution of data from third parties, as long as the data are relevant to lifelong robotic vision research and are in a good enough quality. Please contact [Xuesong Shi](mailto:xuesong.shi@intel.com) for data contribution.

In the following parts we describe how we collect our data.

## Scenes


## Robot and Sensors

We will collect sensor data with a grounded robot, which is like common service robots you would expect in hotels or restaurants. It will move relatively smoothly at a speed of no faster than 1m/s.

The primary sensor is a RealSense D435i camera, mounted at a fixed height of about 1m. It provides aligned color images and depth images, and IMU measurements.
