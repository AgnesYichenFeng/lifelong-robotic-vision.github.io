description: In this post generator of Lie groups as well as subgroup are considered. This short post is a preparation for application of Mathematical theory into QM and CM. This is the third of a series of posts that start from Lie group and Lie algebra.

# Generator in Mathematical View

From last post, a one-to-one correspondence between three entities has been established, namely

- Left-invariant vector field $X$,
- Tangent vector at identity $X_e\in T_eG$,
- One-parameter subgroup $\gamma_X(t)$.

The relationship between them can be summarized as

```mermaid
graph LR
A(Xe)-->|translated, </br>pushed around|B(Left-invariant vector field)
B-->|integral|C(one-parameter subgroup)
A-->|expo|C
```





TeG -push-> left-invar -intgral-> one parm. subgroup



lie group is generated by a neighborhood. How small? as small as a "point" : A tangent space "\cup" Manifold small.

Proposition 0.1 If G is a topological group which is connected then any open set containing the identity element
generates G as a group, i.e. every element of G is a finite product of elements of the open set.
Lemma 0.2 If G is a topological group and g ∈ G then Lg(h) = gh = m(g, h) defines a continuous map G → G.
In fact Lg is a homeomorphism.

As early as
1871, the idea of an infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter group of transformations had already appeared in his work;5 the set of infinitesimal generators

Infinitesimal Group Actions
Just as a one-parameter group of transformations is generated as the flow of a vector
field, so a general Lie group of transformations G acting on a manifold M will be generated
by a set of vector fields on M, known as the infinitesimal generators of the group action.
Each infinitesimal generator’s flow coin

Let G be a connected topological group, U ⊆ G a neigborhood
of 1. Then U generates G.
Proof. For a subset W ⊆ G, write W−1 =

g
−1 ∈ G | g ∈ W
	
. Also, if k
is a positive integer, we set Wk = {a1 . . . ak | ai ∈ W}. Let U be as above,
and V = U ∩ U
−1
. Then, V is open and v ∈ V implies that v
−1 ∈ V . Let
H = ∪∞
n=1V
n
. Then, H is a subgroup and we claim that H is open. Notice
that H is precisely the subgroup generated by U, so if we prove that H is
open, then H = G and the Lemma is proved.
If V
k
is open, then V
k+1 = ∪a∈V (aV k
) is open since left multiplication
is a homeomorhism. By induction, V
n
is open for every n. Thus H is
open

Theorem 2.3.9. Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g.
21
(i) exp(g) generates the identity component of G in the algebraic sense.
(ii) Let F : G → H be a Lie group homomorphism. Then the restriction of F to
G0
is completely determined by F∗ : g → h.
Proof. (i) follows from the fact that exp is a local diffeomorphism from g to G,
hence contains a neighborhood of e ∈ G. (ii) follows from the preceding observation
and the universality of the exponential map, which tells us that knowledge of F∗
completely determines F restricted to the image of the exponential map

Proposition 2.4. An action of a connected Lie group on a manifold M is uniquely
determined by its infinitesimal action

A natural question is, which Lie algebra anti-homomorphism can be integrate to Lie
group actions? Suppose the Lie algebra anti-homomorphism is induced by a G-action
on M, then G × M decompose into submanifolds
Lm = f(g; g · m) j g 2 Gg;
and each Lm projects diffeomorphically to G. So if we let Lm be the \leaf" containing
(e; m), then the point on Lm that projects to g must be (g; g · m). In other words, the
\leaves" determine the Lie group action
