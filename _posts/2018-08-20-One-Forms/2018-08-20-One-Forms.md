One form is a concept useful in integration, the integrand is a one-form. To perform integration on Manifold, one-form is critical.

# Curves and Functions

The definitions of curves and functions are as follow. A curve on a manifold is a linear map from interval $[a,b]$ to a set of points. Functions are defined over curves on manifold, *not* over curves in $\R^n$. With the help of local coordinates, curves and functions each have coordinate representations.

# General Vectors and Covectors

## Vectors

Roughly, a **vector space** is a set of entities such that is closed under linear combinations. Both "arrow heads" and linear functions satisfy this definition and thus form a vector space. Due to this remarkable fact, there exists a subset of vectors called the **basis** in the space, such that any vector in the space can be represented as a linear combination of members of the basis. 

Formally the vector space is a set of four things, $(V,k,+,*) $  where $ V $ is the set of vectors, $K$ is the **field** of scalars involved in creating multiples of vectors, $+$ is the function involved in adding two vectors and $ * $ is the binary function involved in multiplying a vector by a scalar.

## Covectors

Now consider the set of linear functions defined on $V$ (vectors) that have values in $K$ (numbers), i.e. $f:V\rightarrow K$. Such linear functions on vector spaces are called **linear functionals**. They apparently form a vector space $V^*$, since: 

- $(f_1+f_2)(V) = f_1(V) + f_2(V)$ where the R.H.S. is addition of two scalars in the field $K$. 
- $(kf)(V) = kf(V)$, again where the R.H.S. is multiplication of two scalars in the field $K$.

The vector space $V^*$ of linear functionals over $V$ is said to be **dual** to the vector space. 

## Inner Product and Dot Product

The **inner product** $\inner{\;}{\;}$ is defined as

$$
\inner{\dual a}{\vec b}=\dual{\vec a}(\vec b)\in\R
$$

Remember that covector is a linear functional, and the term $\dual{\vec a}(\vec b)$ is indeed a number.

Note that the inner product is defined between a vector and a dual vector and not between two vectors (like dot product). 

The inner product look suspiciously like dot product. A natural insight is that the **dot product** of two vectors is a real number, and thus one can "identify" a covector as a vector, inner product as dot product. This identification is just an isomorphism in the next section.

## Connect Covectors and Vectors with Isomorphism

If  the vector space is finite dimensional, so is its dual space. In this case, these two linear spaces have the same dimension and are thus isomorphic (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Linear_maps_and_matrices)).

This isomorphism is fairly simple: just swap the basis and nothing is changed. 

Here we construct the **covector space** of $V$ and map from vectors to covectors:

1. Suppose the basis for the vector space $V$ is denoted as $(\uvec x_1,\uvec x_2, \uvec x_3)$, where $\uvec x_i$ is a unit vector in the positive $x_i$ direction. Suppose a basis for the dual space $\dual V$ is denoted as $(\d x_1,\d x_2,\d x_3)$ (this suspiciously looking name is carefully chosen for later elaboration, now you can either see it as a derivative $\d$ or simply abbreviation of "dual"). 

2. From the definition, a basis of a dual space is itself a dual vector, which acts on a vector, gives a real number.

   Writing that down as $\d x_i(\vec v)\in \R$.

3. Due to linearity of the vectors and covectors, $\d x_i(\vec v)$ can be seen as act on basis of vector
   $$
   \d x_i(\vec v) =\d x_i (v_1\uvec x_1+v_2\uvec x_2+v_3\uvec x_3)= v_1\d x_i (\uvec x_1)+v_2\d x_i (\uvec x_2)+v_3\d x_i (\uvec x_3)\in \R
   $$

4. Define $\d x_i (\uvec x_j)\dfdas \delta_{i,j}$. Recall that $\d x_i (\uvec x_j)=\inner{\d x_i}{\uvec x_j}=\delta_{ij}$.

5. **[map between bases of vectors and covectors]** A covector $\dual {\vec v}$  of vector $\vec v$ can be written in components $\dual{\vec v}=\dual v^\mu\d x_\mu$, conversely, a vector $\vec{\dual v}$ of a covector $\form v$, $\vec{\dual v}=\dual v^\mu \uvec x_\mu$ by directly interchanging $\d x_\mu$ between $\uvec x_\mu$.

6. A covector $\dual {\vec v}(\vec v)=\dual v^i \d x_i (v^i\uvec x_i)=\dual v^i v_i=\vec{\dual v }\cdot\vec v\in \R$

So the isomorphism can be just $V\leftrightarrow V^*,\quad \uvec x_i \leftrightarrow \d x_i$

> - For vector spaces with finite bases the dual spaces are not very exotic; they are essentially the same as the original spaces. **There are some infinite dimensional vector spaces that have dual spaces that are different in nature from the original space**.
> - If the original space is finite dimensional, vectors can be sent to covectors through a isomorphism. For example, Dirac-bras $ \bra{v} $ and -kets $ \ket{v} $ are dual vectors, the contravariant vector $x^\mu$ and covariant vectors $x_\mu$ are dual to each other. The isomorphisms are both just transpose.

> - A Euclidean vector space comes with a dot product $(x, y) → x·y$, which can be used to describe one-forms in terms of vector fields (or equivalently, to identify cotangent vectors and tangent vectors):  Specifically, for every one-form $\form \omega$ there is a unique vector field ${\scr F }: \R^n\rightarrow V$  such that $\form ω_x(\vec v) \dfdas \vec{F}(x) · \vec{v}$ for all $x\in \R^n, v \in V$.

## Example of Covectors

For future reference, the dual spaces to the spaces of vector fields over Euclidean space is called **differential forms**. For now we will stick to the name covector space. At each point in the space $X$ there is a vector, say $\vec v$. This is equivalent to functions of the form $f:X\rightarrow V=(V,\R,+,*)$; i.e., functions which map every point of the space $X$ into the vector space $V$.

# Vectors on Manifolds

We all know what vector is in Euclidean space, a **vector** is formally defined as an element of a **vector space**, i.e. a set that is closed under finite vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Though on a manifold, things are a little different. There are three equivalent ways of defining vectors. To put them vaguely,

1. Vector is (like in high school) an arrow and can be seen as a tuple of numbers;
2. Vector is an equivalent class of curves;
3. Vector is a (derivation) operator.

These definitions are equivalent to each other [(proof)](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/DG/DG_chap4.pdf). [[Sean Carroll](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9712019.pdf)] gave a very good explanation in Chapter 2. Nevertheless, here are my two cents.

## Vector is an arrow

When I think about vector on a manifold, I have the picture of some arrow tangent to the "surface" of manifold. 

Since in general there is no way to define a "straight arrow" connecting two points. Vectors can only be "tangent vectors". In other words, vectors cannot live on the manifold itself, but the collection of tangent spaces over the entire manifold, called the **tangent bundle**. That way, the vector is a kept at a geometrical view. This is a generalization of the notion of a bound vector in a Euclidean space. But this requires embedding the manifold in some higher dimensional space, which is not very convenient, since Differential Geometry aims at investigating the space (or maybe space-time) without jumping out of it.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yk-liu/yk-liu.github.io/master/_posts/2018-08-20-One-Forms/assets/drawing_tangent_vector.JPG" width="90%">

Obviously, once the vector is in an ambient space, it can be represented by a tuple of numbers. How to represent a vector although "it can be represented by a tuple of numbers"? There will be different basis on each point of a manifold and

## Vector is a (differential) operator

The word "tangent" cries for taking derivatives. Besides, the naïve vector-as-arrow picture lacks necessary algebraic tools to perform calculations with.

Still, the problem is that vectors do not live on the manifold. This forbids defining "what is vector" using vocabularies from manifold, only allowing us to tell "what is in one-to-one correspondence with vector". So what can we identify with vector? The answer is a (differential) operator. 

>  Let's start with a concrete example. Here is a curved surface being the manifold in focus embed in $\R^3$. Although this is not always possible for any manifold, we are going to use this as a tool to gain some intuition.

>
>  First we are going to see the surface in $ \R^3 $ as $\vec r(x,y,z) = Const.$ On this surface we can have different local coordinates $(u,v)$ (left) or $(w,s)$ (right). With a curve $\Sigma$ on the surface we can have both a using embedded coordinates as $\vec r(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))$, or local coordinates as $\vec r(t) = (u(t),v(t))$ or $\vec r(t) = (w(t),s(t))$. The tangent vector $X$ at $p=\vec r(t_0)=(u_0,v_0)=(w_0,s_0)$ has a very simple definition in $\R^3 $ as $\vec X = \D{\vec r(t)}{t}$. Using the chain rule,

By far, $\Eqn{vectorToOperator}$ means any operator have a "component" form using differential operators. $\Eqn{operator_basis}$ means the partial differential operators act like unit vectors or bases of the space of operators. There is nothing we don't already know about differential operators. But the above example provide us a good we to identify a vector with a differential operator.

Reverse the above order, we will find the way to assign an operator to a vector. Starting from a vector $\vec X$, we can choose a basis $\set{\uvec e_1, \uvec e_2}$, where $\vec X = a\uvec e_1+b \uvec e_2$. According to the basis, we can find a local coordinate $(x_ 1,x _2)$. Now combine the differential operators $\set{\Partial{}{x_1},\Partial{}{x_2}}$ like the basis vector, we have the differential operator $a\Partial{}{x_1}+b\Partial{}{x_2}\dfdas X$. We can go further to find some curve (indicated by black lines) $\Gamma : \cases{ u=u(t)\\ v= v(t)}$ such that $ \left( \dot u(t_0) ,\dot v(t_0)\right)=(a,b) $ .

> Note:
>
> The directional derivative of z along the vector v is the differential operator v acting on z.

## Vector is an equivalent class of curves

From above we already know that one can find different curves such that the differential operator have the right coefficient correspond to the vector. If we make a collection of all the curves correspond to the same vector, we would have establish the same "one-to-one" correspondence. 

Here it goes from [Nakahara](http://stringworld.ru/files/Nakahara_M._Geometry_topology_and_physics_2nd_ed..pdf):

>
> then $c_1(t)$ and $c_2(t)$ yield the same differential operator $X$ at $p$, in which case we deﬁne $c_1(t) \sim c_2(t)$. Clearly $ \sim $ is an equivalence relation and deﬁnes the equivalence classes. We identify the tangent vector $X$ with the equivalence class of curves

## Vector field

A vector field can be seen as arrows sprinkled on a manifold as shown in the left. Or it defines a map from a point to a curve on manifold as shown in the right.

#  One-forms

## Covector Revisited

A **one-form**, or a **covector**, **dual vector**, is an element of a **dual vector space**.

A dual vector space is all linear functions that maps a vector to $\R^1$. In another word, 

> A dual vector act on a vector gives a real number.
>
> A dual vector is a linear, real-valued function of vectors.

## One Forms on Manifold

According to $\Eqn{directionalderivative}​$ of [Example of Covectors](#example-of-covectors), the one-form of a tangent vector is the derivative of the function along the vector.

But the tangent vector is on a manifold is in some sense a "directional derivative", and the dual of "directional derivative" is a "gradient", and *vice versa*. 

Recall that a vector is defined as $X\dfdas X^\mu\uvec x_\mu=\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu}$, and vector 's action on a function $f$ is defined as $X[f]\dfdas \D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{f}{x^\mu}$. 

The total derivative $\d $ denoted as a vector as $\vard$. Being a vector, $\vard$ can have it's component form of $\vard = \vard^\mu \uvec d_\mu$, with $\uvec{d}_\mu$ an operator, $\vard^\mu$ a real number seen as a coefficient of linear combination. Write down the component form of this map,

$$
\begin{align}
\inner{\vard}{X}&=\vard (\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu})\notag\\
&=\vard_\nu\uvec{d}^\nu (\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu})\notag\\
\xrightarrow{\text{linearity}}&=\left(\vard_\nu \D{x^\mu}{t}\right)\uvec{d}^\nu ( \Partial{}{x^\mu})\notag\\
\small\text{notice that $\Partial{}{x^\mu}$ is }&\small \text{simply a basis like in $\Eqn{df-nablaf-vec-1}$}\notag\\
&=\left(\vard_\nu \D{x^\mu}{t}\right)\uvec{d}^\nu (\uvec x_\mu)\notag\\
&=\left(\vard_\nu \D{x^\mu}{t}\right)\delta^\nu_\mu \\
&=\vard_\mu \D{x^\mu}{t}\label{dxDef}
\end{align}
$$

The basis of total derivative can now be expressed as $\uvec d^\mu(\uvec x^\nu)=\uvec{d}^\mu ( \Partial{}{x^\nu})=\delta^{\mu,\nu}$. 

Mapping the one-form (total derivative) to a covector (gradient), and take the inner product of the vector and the covector gives $\d x^\mu \cdot \Partial{}{x^\mu}=1$. 

> ***Remark:***
>
> Despite the fact that the covector (gradient) is a vector, it's obvious that gradient lives in a different vector space as tangent vectors does, since their basis is completely different objects. Moreover, There are no dot product defined in tangent space without further mapping, because the product of two tangent vector bases $\Partial{}{x^\mu}$ would not be a number.

Now it's clear that a tangent vector is defined as $X\dfdas X^\mu\uvec x_\mu=\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu}$, the corresponding one-forms are defined as $\dual X \dfdas  X^\mu \dual x_\mu=\D{x^\mu}{t} \d x_\mu$. 

## Example of one-form and Vector

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yk-liu/yk-liu.github.io/master/_posts/2018-08-20-One-Forms/assets/vector.png" width="80%"/>

The vector is the directional derivative of a curve. The one-form is actually the total derivative of the function $f$. The covector is the gradient of the field $f$ over a open set.



## Redefined Vector and one-forms

At the end of [Vectors on a Manifold](#Vectors-on-a-Manifold), vectors were generalized as mathematical objects with the form $X=X^\mu\Partial{}{x^\mu}$. Similarly, the corresponding one-form can be generalized as $\form X= X^\mu \d x_\mu$. This definition will immediate cause a problem: it's no longer guaranteed that a one-form is a total derivative of some function. $x\d y$ is a perfect one-form by this definition, but it is no function's total derivative.

# Two-Forms and Higher Forms

## Wedge Product of General Vectors

The cross product of vectors $\vec u \times \vec v$ is a very useful operation in $3$ dimensional geometry. It determines the area of the **parallelogram** containing these vectors and the plane containing it. A **wedge product** is the analogue used to determine a high dimensional parallelograms.

The wedge (楔) product (楔积) $\wedge$ is a special kind of tensor product. 

$$
\vec x^{\mu_1} \wedge \vec x^{\mu_2} \wedge. . .\wedge \vec x^{\mu_r} = \sum_{P\in \mathbb S_r} \operatorname{sgn}(P) \vec x^{\mu_{P(1)}} \otimes\vec x^{\mu_{P(2)}}\otimes \cdots\otimes \vec x^{\mu _{P(r)}} \label{wedgeDef}
$$

For example, 

$$
\begin{align}
\vec u \wedge \vec v &= \vec u \otimes \vec v - \vec v \otimes \vec u\\
\vec u \wedge \vec v  \wedge \vec w &= \vec u \otimes \vec v  \otimes \vec w + \vec w \otimes \vec u \otimes \vec v  + \vec v  \otimes \vec w \otimes \vec u \label{wedgeExample} \\
&- \vec u \otimes \vec w \otimes \vec v  - \vec w \otimes \vec v  \otimes \vec u - \vec v \otimes \vec u \otimes \vec w \notag
\end{align}
$$

Given a vector space $V$, a space of wedge product can be constructed as

$$
\wedge ^2 V = \set{ \vec u\wedge\vec v  {\mid}  \vec u,\vec v \in V  }\\
\wedge ^3 V = \set{ \vec u\wedge\vec v \wedge \vec w {\mid} \vec u,\vec v,\vec w \in V  }\\
\wedge ^n V = \set{ \vec u_1\wedge\vec u_2 \wedge\cdots\wedge \vec u_n {\mid} \vec u_i\in V ,i=1,2,\cdots,n }
$$

Considering wedge products actually being $n\times n$ antisymmetric tensors can be seen as vectors, it's no wonder that this space is indeed a vector space.

[[John](https://www.av8n.com/physics/area-volume.pdf)] There is a **norm** for a wedge product (seen as a bi-vector, tri-vector, or $n$-vector) defined as 
$$
\begin{align}
\norm{A \wedge B}^2&\dfdas(A \wedge B)\cdot(B \wedge A)\notag\\
&=-(A \wedge B)^2
\end{align}
$$


> ***CONNECTIONS TO GEOMETRIC ENTITIES***:
>
> 1. **Analogue to cross product as a test of collinearity**: The wedge product gives a simple way to test for "**coplanarity**" or linear (in)dependence of vectors: if $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are collinear, meaning $\vec u = a \vec v$, by anti-symmetry of wedge product,

For $n=3$,$ \vec{u} \wedge \vec{v} \wedge \vec{w} = (u_1 v_2 w_3 + u_2 v_3 w_1 + u_3 v_1 w_2 - u_1 v_3 w_2 - u_2 v_1 w_3 - u_3 v_2 w_1) (\uvec{e}_1 \wedge \uvec{e}_2 \wedge \uvec{e}_3) $. Still the volume($3$-dimensional area) $V^2=\norm{\vec{u} \wedge \vec{v} \wedge \vec{w} }$.

While $\vec{u} \wedge \vec{v} \wedge \vec{w}$ is a simple construction of three vectors, it is also a wedge product of vector and yet a wedge product $\vec{u} \wedge (\vec{v} \wedge \vec{w})$. The volume of the parallelepiped ($3$-dimensional area) is now the span of a vector and an parallelogram ($2$-dimensional area). Similarly, a $(n+m)$-dimensional area can be spanned by a $n$-dimensional area and $m$-dimensional area.

## Wedge Product of One-Forms

Naturally, like in [[Redefined Vector and one-forms](#Redefined-Vector-and-one-forms)] a 2-form is of the form $X=X_{\mu\nu}\d x^\mu\d x^\nu$, e.g., $\e^x\d x\d y+2x^2\d y \d z+ (y-x)\d x\d z$. 

This can be seen as a tensor product of two one-forms.
$$
\begin{align}
(3\d x + \d y) ∧ (\e^x\d x + 2\d y) &= 3\e^x\d x ∧ \d x + 6\d x ∧ \d y + \e^x \d y ∧ \d x + 2\d y ∧ \d y\\
&= (6 − \e^x)\d x ∧ \d y
\end{align}
$$

## Exterior Derivative

Another way to see a two-form is that it's a second derivative of something. So take the "derivative" of a $1$-form (first derivative) should result in a $2$-form. This procedure is called a **exterior derivative**. This operation is denoted using again the symbol $\d$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\d (\form X) &= \d (X^\mu \d x_\mu)\\
&=(\d X^\mu )\wedge\d x_\mu + X^\mu\d( \d x_\mu)\\
\xrightarrow[\d( \d x_\mu)=0]{\text{by def.}}&=(\d X^\mu )\wedge\d x_\mu\\
\xrightarrow[\Eqn{dxDef}]{\text{See}}&=\inner{\vard}{X^\mu}\wedge\d x_\mu\\
{\tiny\text{see $\Eqn{df-nablaf-vec-1}$}}&=\Partial{X^\mu}{x_\nu}\d x_\nu \wedge\d x_\mu \\
\xrightarrow[\Eqn{wedgeExample}]{\text{See}}&=\Partial{X^\mu}{x_\nu}\d x_\nu \wedge\d x_\mu 
\end{align*}
$$

For example, 

$$
\d(F \d x+G\d y +H\d z) = (\Partial{G}{x} −\Partial{F}{y})\d x\wedge \d y + (\Partial{H}{y} −\Partial{G}{z})\d y \wedge \d z + (\Partial{F}{z} − \Partial{H}{x})\d z \wedge \d x
$$

This coincides with the definition of **curl**.
$$
\vec{\nabla} \times \vec X = (Hy − Gz)\uvec i + (Gx − Fy)\uvec k + (Fz − Hx)\uvec j
$$




Thus the exterior derivative of a $p$-form is a $(p+1)$-form.


A $2$-form is an expression built using wedge products of pairs of $1$-forms. 









The real significance of $2$-forms will come later when we do surface integrals. A $2$-form will be an expression that can be integrated over a surface in the same way that a $1$-form can be integrated over a curve.
