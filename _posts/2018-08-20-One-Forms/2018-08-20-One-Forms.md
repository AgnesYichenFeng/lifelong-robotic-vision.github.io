# Curves and Functions

The definitions of curves and functions are as follow. A curve on a manifold is a linear map from $[a,b]$ to a set of points. Functions are defined over curves on manifold, *not* over curves in $\R^n$. With the help of local coordinates, curves and functions each have coordinate representations.

# General Vectors and Covectors

## Vectors

Roughly, a **vector space** is a set of entities such that is closed under linear combinations. Both "arrow heads" and linear functions satisfy this definition and thus form a vector space. Due to this remarkable fact, there exists a subset of vectors called the **basis** in the space, such that any vector in the space can be represented as a linear combination of members of the basis. 

Formally the vector space is a set of four things, $(V,k,+,*)$ where $V$ is the set of vectors, $K$ is the **field** of scalars involved in creating multiples of vectors, $+$ is the function involved in adding two vectors and $*$ is the binary function involved in multiplying a vector by a scalar.

## Covectors

Now consider the set of linear functions defined on $V$ that have values in $K$, i.e. $f:V\rightarrow K$. Such linear functions on vector spaces are called **linear functionals**. They apparently form a vector space as well. 

- $(f_1+f_2)(V) = f_1(V) + f_2(V)$ where the R.H.S. is addition of two scalars in the field K. 
- $(kf)(V) = kf(V)$, again where the R.H.S. is multiplication of two scalars in the field K.

The vector space of linear functionals over V is said to be **dual** to the vector space involving V. 

> ***Remark:***
>
> - For vector spaces with finite bases the dual spaces are not very exotic; they are essentially the same as the original spaces. There some infinite dimensional vector spaces that have dual spaces that are different in nature from the original space.
> - If the original space is a finite dimensional, vectors can be sent to covectors through a isomorphism (in coordinates, via transpose).
> - The isomorphism can be written as a definition of map 
>
> $$
> \form v \rightarrow \vec v : \vec v \cdot \vec x =\inner{\form v }{\vec x} 
> \label{1formvec}
> $$
>
> - With a Euclidean vector space, it comes with a dot product $(x, y) → x·y$, which can be used to describe 1-forms in terms of vector fields (or equivalently, to identify cotangent vectors and tangent vectors):  Specifically, for every 1-form $\omega$ there is a unique vector field $\scr F : \R^n\rightarrow\R^n$ such that $ω_x(v) \dfdas F(x) · v$ for all  $x, v \in \R^n$. [[Tao](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/forms.pdf)]

## Inner Product and Dot Product

The **inner product** $\inner{\;}{\;}$ is defined as

$$
\inner{\dual a}{\vec b}=\dual{\vec a}(\vec b)\in\R
$$

Note that the inner product is defined between a vector and a dual vector and not between two vectors or two dual vectors. 

The inner product look suspiciously like dot product. A natural insight is that the **dot product** of two vectors is a real number, and thus a covector can be "identified" as a vector, a inner product as dot product.

## Example of Covectors

Differential forms are the dual spaces to the spaces of vector fields over Euclidean spaces. At each point in the space $X$ there is a vector, say $\vec v$. This is equivalent to functions of the form $f:X\rightarrow V=(V,\R,+,*)$; i.e., functions which map every point of the space $X$ into the vector space $V$.

Here we see how to construct the **covector space** of $V$

1. Suppose the basis for the vector space $V$ is denoted as say $(\uvec x_1,\uvec x_2, \uvec x_3)$, where $\uvec x_i$ is a unit vector in the positive $x_i$ direction. Suppose a basis for the dual space $\dual V$ is denoted as $(\d x_1,\d x_2,\d x_3)$ (this suspiciously looking name is carefully chosen for later elaboration, now you can either see it as a derivative $\d$ or simply abbreviation of "dual"). 

2. From the definition, a basis of a dual space is itself a dual vector, which acts on a vector, gives a real number.

   Writing that down as $\d x_i(\vec v)\in \R$.

3. Due to linearity of the vectors and covectors, $\d x_i(\vec v)$ can be seen as act on basis of vector

    $$
    \d x_i(\vec v) =\d x_i (v_1\uvec x_1+v_2\uvec x_2+v_3\uvec x_3)= v_1\d x_i (\uvec x_1)+v_2\d x_i (\uvec x_2)+v_3\d x_i (\uvec x_3)\in \R
    $$

4. Define $\d x_i (\uvec x_j)\dfdas \delta_{i,j}$. Other choices can always seen as a linear transformation of this simple definition.

5. A covector $\dual {\vec v}$ can be written in components $\dual{\vec v}=\dual v^\mu\d x_\mu$, and can be mapped to a vector \vec{\dual v}=\dual v^\mu \uvec x_\mu.

6. A covector $\dual {\vec v}(\vec v)=\dual v^i \d x_i (v^i\uvec x_i)=\dual v^i v_i=\vec{\dual v }\cdot\vec v\in \R$

# Vectors on a Manifold

A **vector** is formally defined as an element of a **vector space**, i.e. a set that is closed under finite vector addition and scalar multiplication.

On a manifold, **vector** is defined to be a **tangent vector** to a curve in $\mani M$. Note the existence of a vector is independent of the coordinate or function. Like shown below, the "red arrow" tangent to the manifold depend solely on the curve and the point.

<img src="{{page.url}}assets/vector.png" />

Since the directional derivative of a curve in $\R^n$ is easily defined as

$$
\begin{align}
X(0)&=\left.\D{f(c(t))}{t}\right|_{t=0}\notag\\
&=\left.\D{((f \circ \varphi^{-1})(\varphi\circ c )(t))}{t}\right|_{t=0}\notag\\
&=\left.\D{(f \circ \varphi^{-1})(\vec x )}{t}\right|_{t=0}\notag\\
&=\left.\D{((f \circ \varphi^{-1})(x_1(t),x_2(t),\cdots))}{t}\right|_{t=0}\notag\\
&=\left.\Partial{(f \circ \varphi^{-1})}{x^\mu}\D{x^\mu(t)}{t}\right|_{t=0}\notag\\
&=\left.\Partial{(\_ \circ \varphi^{-1})}{x^\mu}\D{x^\mu(t)}{t}\right|_{t=0} f\notag\\
&=\D{x^\mu(t)}{t} \left.\Partial{(\_ \circ \varphi^{-1})}{x^\mu}\right|_{t=0} f\notag\\
&\dfdas  X^\mu \left.\Partial{(\_ \circ \varphi^{-1})}{x^\mu}[f]\right|_{t=0} \label{vec-component}\\
&\dfdas \left.X[f]\right|_{t=0} \label{vec-def}
\end{align}
$$

> ***Remark:***
>
> 1. A tangent vector is not $X[f]$, but $X$. Tangent vector is independent of $\varphi$ or $f$.
> 2. Evidently, due to linearity of derivatives, a tangent vector is still a linear map $X(\alpha f+\beta g) = \alpha X(f) + \beta X(g) $.
> 3. Tangent vectors live on a completely different space, i.e. tangent space. It is *not* the limit of two point on the smooth manifold moving near to each other along a curve, which is still on the manifold. 

Now a vector is a operator act on a function, defined by a curve $c$ and a function $f$ in terms of the directional derivative along the curve. 

Tangent vectors have decompositions $\Eqn{vec-component}$. The $\{\uvec{e}^\mu\} \dfdas \Partial{(\_ \circ \varphi^{-1})}{x^\mu} $ is taken as **coordinate basis**, $X^\mu$ are naturally called the **components** of $X$ with respect to $\uvec{e}^\mu$. 

Reverse the order of definition, a vector can be defined as mathematical objects with the form $X={v_p}^\mu\Partial{}{x^\mu}$, or simply:

> A tangent vector at a point of a manifold is a linear map that satisfies the Leibniz rule.


## Vector field

A vector field can be seen as arrows sprinkled on a manifold as shown in the left. Or it defines a map from a point to a curve on manifold as shown in the right. 

>  A point follows the direction of vector field moves at a "velocity" of the magnitude of the vector, tracing out a curve on the manifold.

#  One-forms

## Covector Revisited

A **one-form**, or a **covector**, **dual vector**, is an element of a **dual vector space**.

A dual vector space is all linear functions that maps a vector to $\R^1$. In another word, 

> A dual vector act on a vector gives a real number.
>
> A dual vector is a linear, real-valued function of vectors.

## One Forms on Manifold

According to $\Eqn{directionalderivative}$ of [Example of Covectors](#Example-of-Covectors), the 1-form of a tangent vector is  the derivative of the function along the vector.

But the tangent vector is on a manifold is in some sense a "directional derivative", and the dual of "directional derivative" is a "gradient", and *vice versa*. 

Recall that a vector is defined as $X\dfdas X^\mu\uvec x_\mu=\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu}$, and vector 's action on a function $f$ is defined as $X[f]\dfdas \D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{f}{x^\mu}$. 

The total derivative $\d $ denoted as a vector as $\vard$. Being a vector, $\vard$ can have it's component form of $\vard = \vard^\mu \uvec d_\mu$, with $\uvec{d}_\mu$ an operator, $\vard^\mu$ a real number seen as a coefficient of linear combination. Write down the component form of this map,

$$
\begin{align*}
\inner{\vard}{X}&=\vard (\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu})\\
&=\vard_\nu\uvec{d}^\nu (\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu})\\
\xrightarrow{\text{linearity}}&=\left(\vard_\nu \D{x^\mu}{t}\right)\uvec{d}^\nu ( \Partial{}{x^\mu})\\
\small\text{notice that $\Partial{}{x^\mu}$ is }&\small \text{simply a basis like in $\Eqn{df-nablaf-vec-1}$}\\
&=\left(\vard_\nu \D{x^\mu}{t}\right)\uvec{d}^\nu (\uvec x_\mu)\\
&=\left(\vard_\nu \D{x^\mu}{t}\right)\delta^\nu_\mu
\end{align*}
$$

The basis of total derivative can now be expressed as $\uvec d^\mu(\uvec x^\nu)=\uvec{d}^\mu ( \Partial{}{x^\nu})=\delta^{\mu,\nu}$. 

Mapping the one-form (total derivative) to a covector (gradient), and take the inner product of the vector and the covector gives $\d x^\mu \cdot \Partial{}{x^\mu}=1$. 

> ***Remark:***
>
> Despite the fact that the covector (gradient) is a vector, it's obvious that gradient lives in a different vector space as tangent vectors does, since their basis is completely different objects. Moreover, There are no dot product defined in tangent space without further mapping, because the product of two tangent vector bases $\Partial{}{x^\mu}$ would not be a number.

Now it's clear that a tangent vector is defined as $X\dfdas X^\mu\uvec x_\mu=\D{x^\mu}{t} \Partial{}{x^\mu}$, the corresponding one-forms are defined as $\dual X \dfdas  X^\mu \dual x_\mu=\D{x^\mu}{t} \d x_\mu$. 

## Example of 1-Form and Vector

<img src="{{page.url}}assets/vector.png" />

The vector is the directional derivative of a curve. The 1-form is actually the total derivative of the function $f$. The covector is the gradient of the field $f$ over a open set.



## Redefined Vector and 1-Forms

At the end of [Vectors on a Manifold](#Vectors-on-a-Manifold), vectors were generalized as mathematical objects with the form $X=X^\mu\Partial{}{x^\mu}$. Similarly, the corresponding 1-form can be generalized as $\form X= X^\mu \d x_\mu$. This definition will immediate cause a problem: it's no longer guaranteed that a 1-form is a total derivative of some function. $x\d y$ is a perfect 1-form by this definition, but it is no function's total derivative.

# Two-Forms and Higher Forms

## Wedge Product of General Vectors

The cross product of vectors $\vec u \times \vec v$ is a very useful operation in $3$ dimensional geometry. It determines the area of the **parallelogram** containing these vectors and the plane containing it. A **wedge product** is the analogue used to determine a high dimensional parallelograms.

The wedge (楔) product (楔积) $\wedge$ is a special kind of tensor product. 

$$
\vec x^{\mu_1} \wedge \vec x^{\mu_2} \wedge. . .\wedge \vec x^{\mu_r} = \sum_{P\in \mathbb S_r} \operatorname{sgn}(P) \vec x^{\mu_{P(1)}} \otimes\vec x^{\mu_{P(2)}}\otimes \cdots\otimes \vec x^{\mu _{P(r)}}\\
$$

For example, 

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec u \wedge \vec v &= \vec u \otimes \vec v - \vec v \otimes \vec u\\
\vec u \wedge \vec v  \wedge \vec w &= \vec u \otimes \vec v  \otimes \vec w + \vec w \otimes \vec u \otimes \vec v  + \vec v  \otimes \vec w \otimes \vec u \notag \\
&- \vec u \otimes \vec w \otimes \vec v  - \vec w \otimes \vec v  \otimes \vec u - \vec v \otimes \vec u \otimes \vec w
\end{align*}
$$

Given a vector space $V$, a space of wedge product can be constructed as

$$
\wedge ^2 V = \set{ \vec u\wedge\vec v {\;\Big|\;} \vec u,\vec v \in V  }\\
\wedge ^3 V = \set{ \vec u\wedge\vec v \wedge \vec w {\;\Big|\;} \vec u,\vec v,\vec w \in V  }\\
\wedge ^n V = \set{ \vec u_1\wedge\vec u_2 \wedge\cdots\wedge \vec u_n {\;\Big|\;} \vec u_i\in V ,i=1,2,\cdots,n }
$$

Considering wedge products actually being $n\times n$ antisymmetric tensors can be seen as vectors, it's no wonder that this space is indeed a vector space.

[[John](https://www.av8n.com/physics/area-volume.pdf)] There is a **norm** for a wedge product (seen as a bi-vector, tri-vector, or $n$-vector) defined as 
$$
\begin{align}
\norm{A \wedge B}^2&\dfdas(A \wedge B)\cdot(B \wedge A)\notag\\
&=-(A \wedge B)^2
\end{align}
$$


> ***CONNECTIONS TO GEOMETRIC ENTITIES***:

> 1. **Analogue to cross product as a test of collinearity**: The wedge product gives a simple way to test for "**coplanarity**" or linear (in)dependence of vectors: if $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are collinear, meaning $\vec u = a \vec v$, by anti-symmetry of wedge product,

> 2. **Analogue to cross product as a indicator of orientation**: If $n\gt 3$, there are infinitely many directions perpendicular to the two vectors, so you can't think of the orientation as a vector (like the cross product in three dimensions). Instead, you may think of the orientation as a *circle* in the plane of the two given vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$, with a direction attached to it in one of the two possible ways: $\circlearrowleft$ or $\circlearrowright$.

> 3. **Analogue to cross product as a way to compute "area of parallelogram"**: For two vectors $\vec u=(a,b,c)$ and $\vec v=(d,e,f)$, We can see that the nonzero entries of wedge product are basically the same as for the cross product.

While $\vec{u} \wedge \vec{v} \wedge \vec{w}$ is a simple construction of three vectors, it is also a wedge product of vector and yet a wedge product $\vec{u} \wedge (\vec{v} \wedge \vec{w})$. The volume of the parallelepiped ($3$-dimensional area) is now the span of a vector and an parallelogram ($2$-dimensional area). Similarly, a $(n+m)$-dimensional area can be spanned by a $n$-dimensional area and $m$-dimensional area.

## Wedge Product of One-Forms

Naturally, like in [[Redefined Vector and 1-Forms](#Redefined-Vector-and-1-Forms)] a 2-form is of the form $X=X_{\mu\nu}\d x^\mu\d x^\nu$, e.g., $\e^x\d x\d y+2x^2\d y \d z+ (y-x)\d x\d z$. 

This can be seen as a tensor product (or better, wedge product) of two 1-forms.
$$
\begin{align}
(3\d x + \d y) ∧ (\e^x\d x + 2\d y) &= 3\e^x\d x ∧ \d x + 6\d x ∧ \d y + \e^x \d y ∧ \d x + 2\d y ∧ \d y\\
&= (6 − \e^x)\d x ∧ \d y
\end{align}
$$

## Exterior Derivative

Another way to see a two-form is that it's a second derivative of something. So take the "derivative" of a 1-form (first derivative) should get a 2-form. This procedure is called a **exterior derivative**.

A $2$-form is an expression built using wedge products of pairs of $1​$-forms. 

The real significance of 2-forms will come later when we do surface integrals. A 2-form will be an expression that can be integrated over a surface in the same way that a 1-form can be integrated over a curve.
