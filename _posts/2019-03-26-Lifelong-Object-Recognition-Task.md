# Lifelong Object Recognition 
- This task intends to explore how to leverage the knowledge learned from previous tasks that could help learn new task better, and also how to efficiently memorize of previously learned tasks. Making the robot behaves like the human with knowledge transfer, association, and combination capabilities.

- From instance-incremental; class-incremental; attribute-incremental. The goal is to test the modelâ€™s capability over continuous learning without forgetting learned patterns at several levels (instances/classes/attributes).

- The final score is obtained via averaging the 3 aspects scores. (1) accuracy over both new and old tasks, e.g. object recognition; (2) the memory efficiency. The model size should be fixed not exceeding our bounded value, and (3) the running time for inference under the same setting. An evaluation metric will be provided.
