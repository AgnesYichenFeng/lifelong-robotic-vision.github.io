# Funny Name

I struggled a little for all the terms in Topology meaning "equivalence" (with their even messier Chinese translations:  homomorphism(同态), isomorphism(同构), homeomorphism(同胚), homotopy(同伦), homology(同调), isotopy(同痕). Well, Zexian Cao wrote an [article](http://www.wuli.ac.cn/fileup/PDF/2014-43-08-010.pdf) in Chinese acclimating the strange names. 

Guess I will write an article once I have understood these concepts. 

Here is a explanation from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homology).

> **Etymology**
>
> From *homo-* +‎ *-logy*.
>
> In mathematics, the term was first used in a topological sense by French polymath [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9), in a sense close to what is now called a *bordism*. Thus, he thought of a **homology** as a relation between [manifolds](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manifold) mapped into a reference manifold. Such manifolds form a **homology** when they form the boundary of a higher-dimensional manifold inside the reference manifold. Poincaré simplified his definition by considering only spaces that were [simplicial complexes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simplicial_complex) (that had a [triangulation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/triangulation)), and only objects in the space made up of [simplices](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simplex) in the triangulation. Eventually, Poincaré's version was replaced by the more general *singular homology*, which is what mathematicians mean by ***homology***.
