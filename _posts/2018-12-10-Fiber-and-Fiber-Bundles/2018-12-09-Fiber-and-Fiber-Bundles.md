# Intuition on Fiber and Fiber bundles

A fiber bundle is just like a bunch of pasta. Each pasta is a fiber. All the pasta put together becomes the entire topological space which we call a fiber bundle. 



Generally speaking, a fiber bundle is a topological space where there are extra structures. This structure is summarized as the topological space locally looks like the direct product of two subspaces - a typical fiber and a base space.



Examples of fiber bundles are 

- Calabi-Yau space. See [here](https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~westra/calabiyau3.pdf), picture from *B.Greene, The Elegant Universe, Vintage, 2000.*

- Hilbert space.
