# Intuition on Fiber and Fiber bundles

A fiber bundle is just like a bunch of pasta. Each pasta is a fiber. All the pasta put together becomes the entire topological space which we call a fiber bundle. 

Generally speaking, a fiber bundle is a topological space where there are extra structures. This structure is summarized as the topological space locally looks like the direct product of two subspaces - a typical fiber and a base space.
