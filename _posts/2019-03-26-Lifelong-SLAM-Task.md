# Lifelong SLAM in the Real Environment
- The task is to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of visual or visual-inertial SLAM algorithms with commodity sensors in dynamic and daily changing environments.

- We intend to provide an advanced benchmark for current and future SLAM research (especially for semantic SLAM) as well as an indicator of their real-world practicality.

- Traditional metrics for SLAM (e.g. ATE, RPE) only measure the accuracy of pose tracking, but for lifelong SLAM the tracking failure rate and re-localization success rate are also important. New metrics shall be designed along with the lifelong learning datasets for SLAM tasks.

# Important Dates
*Dataset Release - June, 2019*
- The teams could choose the sensors and processing platforms. It is a virtual competition (software-level).

*First Round - Sept, 2019*
- Register for the competition first. 
- Download datasets, software tools, and upload the results before the deadline.
- Highest-scored teams will be invited to the final competition.

*Final Round - Nov, 2019*
- A new dataset will be used for the final competition.
- The algorithms from each team shall be run onsite. 
- Results will be visualized in real time for the audience.
