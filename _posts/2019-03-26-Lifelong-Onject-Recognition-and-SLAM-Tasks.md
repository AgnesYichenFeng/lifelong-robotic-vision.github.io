# Lifelong Onject Recognition 
- This task intends to explore how to leverage the knowledge learned from previous tasks that could help learn new task better, and also how to efficiently memorize of previously learned tasks. Making the robot behaves like the human with knowledge transfer, association, and combination capabilities.

- From instance-incremental; class-incremental; attribute-incremental. The goal is to test the modelâ€™s capability over continuous learning without forgetting learned patterns at several levels (instances/classes/attributes).

- The final score is obtained via averaging the 3 aspects scores. (1) accuracy over both new and old tasks, e.g. object recognition; (2) the memory efficiency. The model size should be fixed not exceeding our bounded value, and (3) the running time for inference under the same setting. An evaluation metric will be provided.

# Lifelong SLAM in the Real Environment
- The task is to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of visual or visual-inertial SLAM algorithms with commodity sensors in dynamic and daily changing environments.

- We intend to provide an advanced benchmark for current and future SLAM research (especially for semantic SLAM) as well as an indicator of their real-world practicality.

- Traditional metrics for SLAM (e.g. ATE, RPE) only measure the accuracy of pose tracking, but for lifelong SLAM the tracking failure rate and re-localization success rate are also important. New metrics shall be designed along with the lifelong learning datasets for SLAM tasks.
