## Topology

### definitions

- A **metric** on a set $X$ is a function$d: X \times X \rightarrow \R$ such that

$$
\begin{align*}
d(x,y)&=d(y,x ) & \quad \text{(interchangeble),} \\
d(x,y) &\gt 0, x\neq y  & \quad \text{(semi-positive-definite),} \\
d(x,y)+d(y,z) &\ge d(x,z) & \quad \text{(trangular inequality).}
\end{align*}
$$

The space $X$ endowed with  a metric $d$  is called a **metric space**, denoted as $(X,d)$

- An **open $\epsilon$-neighborhood** is the open ball $U_{d,\epsilon}(x)=\{y\in X : d(x, y)<\epsilon\}$ where $\epsilon \gt 0$. 
- A set $\Os\in X$ of a metric space is called **open** if for each $x\in \Os, \Exist \epsilon>0 $ such that $U_\epsilon \subseteq \Os $ .
- A function $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is **continuous at a point** $x_0\in X$ between two metric spaces $(X,d_x)$ and $(Y,d_y)$, if for all $f(x)\in U_{d_y,\delta}(f(x_0))$, exist a $\epsilon$ such that $x\in U_{d_x,\epsilon}(x_0)$.
  - Nearby points are from nearby points. **NOT** *Nearby points to nearby points*. 
    - Continuous map does not necessarily take open sets to open sets: take, e.g. $f(x)=x^2$on $\Reals\rightarrow\Reals$. Then the open set $(−1,1)$ is sent to the non-open set $[0,1)$. 
    - The constant map $f:\R→\R$ given by $f(x)=0$ is continuous but the image of any open set $U$ under $f$ is ${0}$ which is not open in $\R$. 
    - A map $f:X→Y$ between topological spaces such that $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ whenever $U$ is open in $X$ is called an [open map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_and_closed_maps). A famous example of a map that is open but not continuous is the [floor function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions) $⌊\ ⌋:\R→\Z$. 
  - (The notion of continuity only depends on the system of open sets of a metric space and not of the actual distances between points.)
  - Here no limit is taken to allow discrete sets have continuous functions. 

- A family $\T$of subsets of set $X$ is called a topology on $X$ if it `1.` contains $X$ and the empty set, as well as `2. `finite intersections and `3.`arbitrary unions of elements of $\mathcal{T}$:
    1. $\emptyset \in \T, X\in \T$, 
    2. $\Os_{1}\cap \Os_{2}\in \T$,
    3. $\displaystyle \bigcup_{i\in I}\Os_{i}\in T \quad \forall \Os_{i}\in \T$.
      The sets $\Os_i$ are called open sets.

- The power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and $\{\emptyset,\ X\}$ are called **discrete** and **indiscrete** topology, respectively. With every metric space there comes the **natural topology**, whose open sets are the unions of open balls. The natural topology on $\Reals^{n}$ is given by the unions of the open balls $U_\epsilon(x)=\{y\in X : d(x, y)\lt\epsilon\}$ for some $\epsilon\in \Reals_+$.

- Two topological spaces $(X_1, T_{1})$ and $(X_{2}, \T_{2})$ are called homeomorphic iff there exists a bijection $f$ : $X_{1}\rightarrow X_{2}$ that induces a bijective map $f$ : $\mathcal{T}_{1}\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_{2}$ of the topologies. The map $f$ is called a **homeomorphism**. 

- A map $g$: $X\rightarrow X'$ is called continuous iff the sets $g^{-1}(\mathcal{O}')\in \mathcal{T}$ are open in $(X,\T)$ for all open sets $\mathcal{O}'\in \mathcal{I}'$. Equivalently, $g$ is continuous iff all inverse images of closed sets are closed. A bijective map $h$ is a homeomorphism iff it is $\mathrm{b}\mathrm{i}$-continuous, i.e. iff $h$ and $h^{-1}$ are both continuous.

    For each subset $M\subseteq X$ we can define the induced topology, which is given by the set of intersections $\mathcal{O}_{i}\cap M$ with $\mathcal{O}_{i}\in \mathcal{T}$. For two topological spaces $(A,\ \mathcal{T}_{A})$ and $(B,\ \mathcal{T}_{B})$ we can define the product topology on $A\times B$ by declaring the products of open sets to be open. These products thus form a basis of the product topology, i.e. every open set is a union of finite intersections of the basic open sets. $(\mathrm{I}\mathrm{n}$ fact, every subset $\mathrm{o}\mathrm{f}\ \mathcal{P}(X)$ is a basis of the topology that it generates in the described way.) Similar definitions can be used to define the image or preimage topology with respect to some function if the domain or the image of the function is equipped with a topology, respectively.

    The smallest closed subset of $X$ that contains $M\subset X$ is called the closure $\overline{M}$ of $M$ in {\it X}. The interior $M^{0}$ of $M$ is defined to be the largest open set contained in {\it M}. $(\overline{M}$ and $M^{0}$ are given by the intersection/union of all closed/open sets containing/contained in $M.$) A subset $M\subset X$ is called dense in $X$ iff $X=\overline{M}$. The difference $\partial M:=\overline{M}\backslash M^{0}$ is called the

    boundary of $M$. A subset $\mathcal{U}\subset X$ is called a neighborhood of $x\in X$ iff $x$ is contained in an

    open subset of $\mathcal{U}$. Note that a subset $S\subseteq X$ is open iff it is a neighborhood of all of it points. (Using this correspondence, topological spaces may equivalently be defined by a set of axioms for neighborhoods, with open sets being a derived concept.)

    A family of subsets $M_{i}\subseteq X$ is called a covering of $X$ if $X=\cup M_{i}$. A topological space $(X,\ \mathcal{T})$ is called Hausdorff space iff any two points can be separated by neighborhoods (i.e. iff $\forall x\neq y\in X$ there exist $\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}\in \mathcal{T}$ with $ x\in \mathcal{U}\wedge y\in \mathcal{V}\wedge \mathcal{U}\cap \mathcal{V}=\emptyset$). A subset $A\subseteq X$ is called quasi-compact if each covering of $\mathcal{A}$ by open sets $\mathcal{O}_{i}$ contains a finite subcovering, it is called

    compact if it is quasi-compact and Hausdorff, and it is called locally compact if each point

    $x\in X$ has a compact neighborhood. More generally, any property of a topological space with the adjective (locally' will mean that each point has a basis of neighorhoods with that property.

    Example: Let $A^{n}=\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\ \ldots,\ x_{n}]$ be the polynomial ring in $n$ complex varibles and regard $x_{i}$ {\it Geometry, Topology and Physics} $I$ -- 3 -- {\it M.Kreuzer} / version {\it September 30, 2009}

    as coordinates of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. For any subset $T\subseteq A^{n}$ of polynomials the vanishing set is defined as
    \begin{center}
    $Z(T)=\{x\in \mathbb{C}^{n}|P(x)=0\forall P\in T\}$   (1.3)
    \end{center}
    A subset of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is called algebraic if it is equal to the set of solutions $Z(T)$ of some set $T$ of polynomials. Unions $Z(T_{1})\cup Z(T)$ of algebaic sets are algebraic, with $T=\{P_{i}(x) P(x)$ : $P_{i}\in T_{1}, P_{j}\in T_{2}\}$, and arbitrary intersections are also algebraic. They can thus be taken to be the closed sets of a topology, called the Zariski topology $\mathcal{T}_{Z}$, which is frequently used in algebraic geometry. $(\mathbb{C}^{n},\ Z(T))$ is not Hausdorff, but quasicompact because any algebraic set is the zero set of a {\it finite set} of polynomials, and all but a finite set of its defining polynomial equations are redundant (this is essentially the content of Hilbert's basis theorem [C098]).

    Theorems: $\bullet$ Compact subsets $A\subseteq X$ of a Hausdorff space $X$ are closed.

    $\bullet$ Closed subspaces and continuous images of compact spaces are compact.

    $\bullet$ Metric spaces $M$ are compact iff every sequence in $M$ contains a convergent subsequence. $\bullet$ A subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is compact iff it is bounded and closed [Heine-Borel].

    A compact topological space $(\tilde{X},\tilde{\mathcal{I}})$ is called a compactification of $(X,\ \mathcal{I})$ if $X$ is (home- omorphic to) a dense subset of $\tilde{X}$ and if $\mathcal{T}$ is the topology that is induced on $X$ by $\tilde{\mathcal{T}}$. All locally compact spaces can be compactified in the following way by adding only a single point [Alexandroff]: Define $\tilde{X}=X\cup\{\omega\}$ with $\mathcal{O}\not\in X$ and let $\tilde{\mathcal{I}}$ contain all open sets $\mathcal{O}\in \mathcal{I}$ and, in addition, all subsets $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\subseteq\tilde{X}$ that contain $\omega$ and whose complement $\tilde{X}-\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ is a compact subset of $X$. It can be checked that $\tilde{\mathcal{T}}$ is a topology on $\tilde{X}$ and that the resulting topological space is compact. ({\it X} is dense in $\tilde{X}$ if $X$ is not compact. It can be shown that the one point compactification is unique up to homeomorphisms.)
