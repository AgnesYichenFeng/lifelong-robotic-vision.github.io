# *Welcome!*

I am *Yingkai Liu*, a student major in Physics with a broad interest.

This is a minimal set up mainly using  [`typora`](https:\\www.typora.io).



Here are [`my posts`](https://yk-liu.github.io/posts/post_index.html). 

- There are study notes as well as Python/Linux notes. Updates are slow.

- Most of them will be in Chinese. I will try to translate some of the best of them to English when I have time.

  â€‹

Here is a list of [`my repos`](https://yk-liu.github.io/repos/repo_index.html).

- I hardly have any spare time for coding as a hobby now. But the [`flea`](https://github.com/yk-liu/flea) project should at least work. It facilitated my class assignments a lot.
