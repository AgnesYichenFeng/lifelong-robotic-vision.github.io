# Commenting FAQs & Guidelines

## Why aren't my comments shown on the page?

Well, this website means *a lot* to me. I don't want to get into any trouble because anyone else's comments. **So all comments will be moderated**. So it might take a few days before it finally shows up on the website. Still, I reserve the right to edit or delete comments that do not meet the standards. See how the system ([comm(enit\|it)](https://commentit.io/)) works [here](https://commentit.io/faq).

## Do you read comment?

**Yes**. All comments on any of the post, no matter how long ago it was posted, is visible to me as soon as you posted it. 

I read your comments because your comments matter to me.

First of all, I get encouragement from comments ( this is the main reason I opened the comment section).

Second, I am aware that I will be making mistakes on posts. Some maybe grammatic, some might be of facts. Commenting is the most effective way for you to reach out to me so I can correct them. 

## What are the guidelines of posting a comment?

Well, there really isn't much. **You can be a resource for your fellow readers and I sincerely hope that you’ll use our comment section to do that**. Just follow your common sense and you should be good. For those who really need a document, here are the rules.

### Stay on point.

When making a comment, try not to go off-topic. 

### Show respect.

I encourage and appreciate thoughtful debate. Just make sure that when you disagree with the author or another commenter, you do so in a respectful and courteous manner.
