# Commenting and Discussion FAQs & Guidelines

## Why my comments not shown on the page?

Well, this website means alot to me. I don't want any possible

We want you to be a resource for your fellow readers and we hope that you’ll use our comment section to do that. We’ve designed it to elevate and amplify the most intelligent and civil responses, and diminish or hide the worst. These are the rules of the road:

## I read comments.
Though I may not be monitoring the comment section on a daily basis, I do pay close attention to them. I reserve the right to edit or delete comments that do not meet the standards.

## Stay on point.
When making a comment, don't go off-topic. You can make suggestions that you think can make 

## Show respect.
We encourage and appreciate thoughtful debate. Just make sure that when you disagree with a story's premise or another commenter that you do so in a respectful and courteous manner.

## Be responsible and authentic.
Post only your opinions in your own words. You are responsible for the content you post.

## Don't post spam or ads.
This website is not a billboard for your business. Don't post spam, self-promotional content, or ad campaigns.
